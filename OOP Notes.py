#object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. 
#The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

"Importance of OOP"
#Modularity: Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier.
#Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times.
#Productivity: Programmers can construct new programs quicker through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.
#Easily upgradable and scalable: Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
#Interface descriptions: Descriptions of external systems are simple, due to message passing techniques that are used for objects communication.
#Security: Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.
#Flexibility: Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
